Hi there!
I am a recent Computer Science MEng graduate with an interest in the intersection between art and computing. My research interests have most recently led me to explore data-driven methods for motion generation.
Outside of CompSci I like to paint, make stuff in Blender and outside pandemic times I'm working towards my BSAC Sports Diver qualification.
